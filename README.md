## Modular Routers

### Description

Modular Routers is a Forge mod which adds one block: the Item Router, and several routing modules and upgrades.  The
Item Router has a single-slot buffer to hold items, and does nothing by itself, other than to execute (in order) any
modules installed in it.  These modules define the behaviour - moving items around, pulling from adjacent inventories,
placing/dropping items & blocks in the world, etc.
